# Developer Guide

If you are using previous release of Wgl for some reason, you can generate documentation for that release by following these steps:

- Install [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/) on your platform.

- Download and extract `Source code (zip)` for your target release at [**Wgl Repo**](https://github.com/bitlaab-bolt/wgl)

- Now, `cd` into your release directory and run: `mkdocs serve`
