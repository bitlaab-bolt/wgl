**Window Graphics Library Bindings for Zig**

Wgl is intended to be a high-level abstraction for cross-platform window creation and management. Along with abstraction, Wgl exposes underlying API bindings for more custom-tailored functionality.

The underlying API bindings are implemented on a need-per-basis. If you need other platform support or API code coverage, Please create an issue at [**Wgl Repo**](https://github.com/bitlaab-bolt/wgl) and buy us some coffee.
