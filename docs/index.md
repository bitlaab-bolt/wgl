# Getting Started

**An image manipulation library bindings for Zig.**

Lime is intended to be a high-level abstraction for image manipulation in various formats, such as `JPEG`, `PNG`, `GIF`, `WebP`, etc. Along with abstraction, Lime exposes underlying API bindings for more custom-tailored functionality.

The underlying API bindings are implemented on a need-per-basis. If you need other platform support or API code coverage, Please create an issue at [**Lime Repo**](https://github.com/bitlaab-bolt/lime) and buy us some coffee.
