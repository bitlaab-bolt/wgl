# wgl

**Window Graphics Library Bindings for Zig**

Wgl is intended to be a high-level abstraction for cross-platform window creation and management. Along with abstraction, Wgl exposes underlying API bindings for more custom-tailored functionality.

## Platform Support

As of now, Wgl supports **Windows** (x64) and **MacOS** (Apple silicon). Please create an issue if you need other platform support for your use case.

## Dependency

### MacOS

All dependencies are linked as static libraries. No additional steps are required!

### Windows

The final executable requires `glfw3.dll`. The necessary steps are in the documentation's **Installation** section.

## Documentation

For most up-to-date documentation see - [**Wgl Documentation**](https://bitlaabwgl.web.app/).
